Programming-Task
================

In pom.xml, there is only one dependency which is aws-java-sdk for Amazon AWS API.

I added java-api-wrapper for SoundCloud to pom.xml to download from Maven automatically but it didn't work. Maven did not download this jar, so I added "java-api-wrapper-1.2.0-all.jar" externally to class path.

My AWS S3 credentials:
access_key: AKIAJZWAIDVH7T3WQWYA
secret_key: 67KMszx2gZx9+9ANVpRhXJtHER1LiaD/qpMXQLIy

Sample SoundCloud username with a downloadable song:
emre-tetik
